# MST_projetINF442

MST use in Data Analysis, May 2020

The objective of this project is to understand and implement sequential and parallel algorithms for minimum-spanning-tree (MST) search in a graph, in order to be able to use efficient MST-Clustering methods and test it on public datasets.

Task 1: Implementation of PRIM and BORUKVA -sequential algorithms for MST search- in file test-graph.cpp

Task 2: Implementation of KRUSKAL -sequential algorithm for MST search- in file test-graph.cpp

*note: for parallel algorithm, we use the MPI (Message Passing Interface) standard for C/C++

Task 3: Implementation of PRIM's algorithm adapted for parallel computing. in file parallel-prim.cpp 

Task 4: Implementation of GHS (Gallager-Humblet-Spira) algorithm for MST construction in asynchronous Message-passing model. in file ghs_fromscratch.cpp

Task 5: Implementation of an MST-based clustering strategy. in file test-graph.cpp

Task 6: Testing results on public datasets such as iris.csv
